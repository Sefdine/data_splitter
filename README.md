# Dataset Splitter for JSON, CSV, and SQL Server

## Overview:
This project aims to load a dataset from a CSV file, perform a random split of the rows based on user-defined percentages, and store the resulting splits in a JSON file, CSV file, and SQL Server database.

## Usage:
To use this dataset splitter, the user can specify the desired percentage for each split. If no percentages are provided, the default values will be used:

 - 30% for the JSON file
 - 40% for the CSV file
 - 30% for the SQL Server database
